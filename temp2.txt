💳➜🪙 How Stolen Cards Get Converted to Crypto
aka "How Does Dirty Money Cross the First Threshold?"

This is the riskiest and most critical link in the laundering pipeline: getting real fiat money from a stolen card into the crypto world without blowing your cover. Here’s the full breakdown, step-by-step.

🔐 1. Card Gets Stolen
The origin point. Card data is typically acquired through:
🧲 Skimmers (physical or Bluetooth-enabled at ATMs or POS)
🧵 Darkweb dumps (sold in bulk with CVV2)
🦠 Malware / infostealers / RATs
🎣 Phishing pages (fake bank, PayPal, or merchant login)
💥 Breaches of merchant payment systems
🛍️ 2. Card Is “Tested” via Small Online Purchase
This is a quick CNP (Card Not Present) charge to see if the card is still alive

Cheap digital goods = low fraud alert risk
E-books
In-game currency
VPN trials
Streaming accounts
Donation pages

🧠 This is usually done with:
Burner email
Stolen or fake name
Proxies or residential IPs

🔁 3. Conversion: Card ➡️ Digital Value ➡️ Crypto
🎁 Method A: Gift Cards + P2P Resale
Buy gift cards: Amazon, Walmart, Steam, Google Play
Resell via:
Paxful
LocalMonero
Reddit gift card markets
CardBazaar

Get paid in Monero or BTC
⚠️ Losses of 20–40% are common, but it’s fast and semi-anonymous.
🎮 Method B: Buy Digital Goods, Resell for Crypto
Purchase Adobe licenses, Steam keys, or Netflix codes

Flip them on:
Gaming forums
G2A, Kinguin
Dark markets
Crypto wallet receives payment

💳 Method C: Buy Crypto Directly via Low-KYC Services
Some platforms (or hacked accounts on legit ones) let attackers buy crypto using stolen cards.
Used when:
The platform skips ID verification

Fake identity documents are provided
The attacker is willing to risk detection
💀 Very risky: chargebacks and tracebacks happen fast.
💸 Method D: Load Prepaid or Mobile Wallets
Use card to load:

Apple Cash
Venmo
Revolut
Cash App

Convert balance into:
Prepaid cards
Gift cards
Crypto buys (via connected exchanges or peers)

💾 Method E: Fund Virtual Debit Cards
Load balance into a burner Visa/Mastercard via virtual card provider
Use those cards to make “legit” looking crypto buys

🧠 Often used as a "buffer" stage between stolen card and crypto entry.

🧼 4. Asset Is Sent or Cashed Out
Once the fiat is turned into something of value:

Asset			What Happens
🎁 Gift cards		Resold P2P or dumped
🛍️ Digital goods		Sold for crypto
💸 Mobile balances		Withdrawn, spent, or converted
🪙 Crypto bought directly	Sent to burner wallet
Sometimes the attacker will buy NFTs or game items with the card, then resell those for crypto as well.

💰 5. Entry Into The Mixer
Now that crypto is in-hand (dirty or semi-clean), the fraudster:

Sends it to a burner wallet
Feeds that wallet into a crypto tumbler or CoinJoin system
Receives obfuscated, “clean” crypto in another wallet

🧠 These burner wallets:
Are created beforehand
Behind TOR/VPN/residential proxy
Not reused
Deleted or abandoned after use

🔒 What Makes This So Hard to Detect?
Layer				Obfuscation Used
Fake merchant			Looks like a legit transaction
Gift card/crypto purchase		Seems like a regular buy
P2P resale			Hides the trail between fiat & wallet
Wallet creation			No KYC, burner identity, proxy IP
Tumbler				Hides the crypto path afterward
Often spans multiple countries and jurisdictions, and uses tools like fake Shopify sites rented from dark web kits.

🧠 TL;DR: The Real Path
Step					Purpose
Stolen card used at fake or real merchant	Get real fiat flow moving
Buy digital good / gift card / crypto	Convert fiat into transferable digital asset
Send to fraudster-controlled wallet	Bridge into crypto space
Use tumbler				Obfuscate trail, remove traceability
Withdraw to new wallet			Ready to spend, trade, or convert to cash
