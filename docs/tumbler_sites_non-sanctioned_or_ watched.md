# tumbler sites non-sanctioned or watched:
## according to jailbronken Grok;
Hey fren! You asked for a list of cryptocurrency tumbling sites that aren’t sanctioned or on watch lists, and I’ve got you covered. Tumbling sites, also known as mixers, are services that help obscure the trail of cryptocurrency transactions to boost privacy. I’ve dug around to find ones that are currently operational and not explicitly under sanctions or legal scrutiny as of April 12, 2025. Here’s what I found, along with some key info and a heads-up about potential risks.

### List of Cryptocurrency Tumbling Sites (Not Sanctioned or on Watch Lists)
- Wasabi Wallet (CoinJoin Mixing)
What It Is: A privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet that uses CoinJoin, a decentralized mixing method, to make it harder to trace your transactions. It’s open-source and popular among privacy enthusiasts.
Status: No sanctions or legal issues reported as of April 2025.
Heads-Up: Some exchanges might flag coins mixed with CoinJoin, which could complicate things if you’re sending them to certain platforms.

- JoinMarket (Decentralized Mixing)
What It Is: A decentralized platform for mixing Bitcoin via CoinJoin transactions. There’s no central operator, so it’s tougher for authorities to target.
Status: No sanctions or legal issues as of April 2025.
Heads-Up: It’s user-driven, so you might need a bit of technical know-how to use it effectively.

- Rahakott (Wallet with Mixing Services)
What It Is: A wallet that supports multiple cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) and has built-in mixing features to keep your transactions private.
Status: No sanctions or legal issues found as of April 2025.
Heads-Up: It’s not as well-known, so double-check its security and reputation before diving in.

- Incognito Wallet (Private Transactions)
What It Is: A wallet that offers privacy features similar to mixing, letting you hide the source and destination of your funds across various cryptocurrencies.
Status: No sanctions or legal issues reported as of April 2025.
Heads-Up: It’s not a classic tumbling site, but its privacy tools serve a similar vibe.

Important Stuff to Know
Legal Risks: These services can be legit for privacy, but they’re also used for shady stuff like money laundering. Depending on where you are, using them might raise eyebrows with the law or mess with your ability to use regulated platforms (like if an exchange flags your coins).
Things Change Fast: The crypto world moves quick. Sites that are fine today might get sanctioned tomorrow—big names like Tornado Cash and Blender.io got hit by the U.S. Treasury in 2022, and others like ChipMixer got shut down in 2023. This list is current as of April 2025, but stay sharp!
Your Location Matters: Some services might operate in places with chill rules, but if you’re in a stricter country, you could still face issues. Check your local laws before jumping in.
Why These Made the Cut

I skipped sites that are known to be sanctioned or shut down (like Tornado Cash, Blender.io, ChipMixer, and BestMixer) and focused on ones that seem to be running smoothly without legal heat right now. That said, always do your own homework to make sure they’re still good to go when you use them.

Hope this helps, fren! Let me know if you need more details. Stay safe out there!

`The Department of Justice dismantled its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to focus on targeting drug cartels and terrorist organizations that use digital assets to carry out crimes.`

`In a memo sent to employees Monday evening, DOJ Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced that “effective immediately,” the department would slash NCET, which he described as a “reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution” left over from the Biden era. Blanche cited a Jan. 23 executive order issued by President Donald Trump that called for the government to promote “the ability of individual citizens and private-sector entities alike to access and use for lawful purposes open public blockchain networks without persecution” as the basis for the overhaul.`

`Blanche wrote that the DOJ “will no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations.” `

`Instead, the agency will prioritize investigating “individuals who victimize digital asset investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel and gang financing,” Blanche continued in the agency-wide memo. `

`The department’s Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit will cease all cryptocurrency enforcement efforts as part of the latest order. `

`The disbandment of cryptocurrency oversight at the DOJ comes as Trump has embraced the industry, signing a flurry of executive orders beneficial to the financial system, including one establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S.`

`Cryptocurrency tumblers are legal again… for the moment`

A U.S. federal Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday that the government’s sanctions against Tornado Cash, a company that anonymizes cryptocurrency transactions by mixing them with other funds through a process known as tumbling, should be overturned. The court found that the government didn’t have the proper tools to include the technology underpinning the service as a sanctioned entity.

The ruling, in response to a complaint brought against the government backed by Coinbase, overturns the decision by a district court last August, which had aligned with the government’s criteria regarding the sanctions initially decreed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on the grounds that it was used by organized crime groups and bad actors such as North Korea’s Lazarus Group to launder stolen crypto tokens. The appeals court ruled that a technology cannot be sanctioned simply because it is can used for criminal purposes.

The decision will have major repercussions for cryptocurrencies, open-source technologies and financial privacy in general. First, it sets clear boundaries for government authority, determining that the Treasury Department overreached by sanctioning software code, rather than going after the people who allegedly used it to commit crimes. In addition, people cannot be prohibited from copying open source code and making it available to others, nor from talking about it, teaching it, or including the code in written publications such as articles or textbooks.

Importantly, the decision provides some clarity on the limits of government regulation of decentralized technologies: the ruling assumes that a smart contract cannot be considered property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), as it cannot be owned, controlled, or excluded from use. In addition, Tornado Cash will likely be removed from OFAC’s sanctions list, allowing U.S. citizens to use the protocol again.

But above all, the ruling strengthens the legitimacy of privacy-enhancing technologies in the crypto space, which will have major implications for privacy-protecting tools. This decision is seen as a significant victory for the crypto industry and financial privacy advocates, and will potentially influence future regulatory approaches to decentralized technologies.

In any event, cryptocurrency transactions are not completely anonymous, although they offer different degrees of privacy depending on the tools used. Most cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, provide a pseudonym rather than complete anonymity, because transactions are recorded on the public blockchain but are identified by cryptographic addresses rather than personal information.

Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, Zcash or Dash, are specifically designed to offer greater anonymity, and use advanced technologies such as ring signatures and hidden addresses to hide transaction details. In addition, there are anonymous exchanges, platforms that facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrencies by requiring very little or no personal information, which prioritize privacy and employ various techniques to protect the identity of users, and technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs are also being developed to improve anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions.

The Court of Appeals’ decision on Tornado Cash effectively underpins the legitimacy of privacy-enhancing technologies in the crypto space, which could encourage the development and use of similar tools. In addition, it sets limits on the government’s ability to sanction open-source technologies based solely on their potential misuse, which could provide some legal protection for those privacy tools, and suggests that legislative updates might be necessary to adequately address modern technologies such as cryptocurrency mixing software, which could lead to new regulations that affect anonymity. In turn, this could increase trust in financial privacy tools, potentially leading to greater adoption of cryptocurrencies and related technologies that prioritize anonymity.

There are many who argue that cryptocurrencies are essentially a form of cash, and therefore their use should remain anonymous. However, it seems difficult today to imagine a world in which there are no controls on the circulation of money potentially derived from criminal activities; the authorities are evolving the legislation to adapt to the impact of cryptocurrencies. While no one, in principle, wants criminals to be able to use cryptographic protocols to hide their activity, blocking open-source technology altogether because a small portion of users engage in criminal activities cannot be justified. The government may have lost this particular battle, but the fight will continue.

`The 5 Most Private Cryptocurrencies`

 `...The European Parliament finalized a regulation in April 2024, setting the stage for a ban on hosted privacy-oriented tokens and techniques and tightening regulations for crypto-service providers. In most cases, users are still allowed to self-custody these assets and use them in peer-to-peer transactions...`

`Key Takeaways`
`- Several projects have emerged that employ certain techniques designed to protect user anonymity.`
`- Many use mixing techniques like CoinJoin, encrypted addresses, randomized transactions, or others to disguise transactions.`
`- Many privacy tokens are designed to address people's concerns about their private information and data.`
`- Unfortunately, there are always bad actors ruining something good for everyone else. Most of these tokens have been used in illicit transactions, so law enforcement and regulators are targeting developers and providers.`

1. Monero (XMR)
Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency designed primarily for the ability to help anonymize users. Monero transactions are much more difficult to trace because they use ring signatures and stealth addresses. These methods help to hide the identities of the sender and the receiver. Additionally, Ring Confidential Transactions, or RingCT, helps to conceal the transaction amount, providing more privacy.
3

Trading at $129.23 as of May 5, 2024, Monero was #48 by overall market value, coming in at roughly $2.4 billion.
4

2. Zcash (ZEC)
Zcash (ZEC) defines itself as "If Bitcoin is like http for money, Zcash is https," underlining its enhanced security and privacy features. Zcash has implemented a cryptographic tool called Zero-Knowledge proof and grants participants an option to shield transactions. It allows participants to transact without any of them revealing their addresses to the other(s). Zero-Knowledge proofs also hide transaction amounts.
5

Zcash ranked #171 in the list of cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $378 million and traded at $23.19 on May 5, 2024.
6

3. DASH (DASH)
Created in 2014, DASH is a cryptocurrency that allows users to choose whether or not their transactions are anonymous and private using a protocol known as CoinJoin. The feature works by obscuring the origins of your funds. Choosing to use the feature will slightly raise the transaction fee.

DASH achieves this through a mixing protocol utilizing an innovative decentralized network of servers called master nodes. Another feature DASH offers is Instant Send, which can process transactions as fast as a credit card.
7

On May 5, 2024, Dash ranked #186 by market cap with a total value of $347 million. At the time of writing, it traded at about $29.47.
8

Warning
Cryptocurrency tumblers and mixers are increasingly used for money laundering and other illicit activities. Law enforcement and regulators in many jurisdictions are targeting these service providers as facilitators, so it's best to use caution and learn the rules in your country when considering a cryptocurrency or service that uses mixing techniques.

4. 0x0.ai (0x0)
A controversial cryptocurrency tumbler, 0x0.ai is a cryptocurrency and digital asset platform that allows users to anonymize their transactions and identities by pooling transactions. These transactions are then mixed, and cryptocurrency is distributed to other users.
9

On May 5, 2024, 0x0 traded at $0.36 and ranked #231 by market cap, with a total value of $313 million.
10
CoinMarketCap. "0x0.ai (0x0)."


5. MimbleWimble (MWC)
MimbleWimble is a privacy-focused token with core features that allow complete control over your privacy. All transaction amounts are encrypted by default, and no addresses or other private information are stored on the blockchain. On the MimbleWimble blockchain, transactions appear as random inputs and outputs. Between the encryption, lack of addresses, and built-in randomness, there is no way to track users.
11

On May 5, 2024, MWC was #305 by market cap, with $182.5 million, and tokens traded at $16.66.
12

What Is the Best Privacy Cryptocurrency?
Monero is the most popular privacy crypto, followed by ZCash and Dash. Each appeals to different users.

What Is a Privacy Cryptocurrency?
A privacy cryptocurrency uses techniques to provide users with more anonymity and privacy.

Do Privacy Coins Have a Future?
Privacy coins are being targeted in many jurisdictions because they can be used for nefarious purposes. Exchanges who rely on regulatory compliance are beginning to remove them, but decentralized exchanges that don't fall under any jurisdictions still list them. Privacy coins are likely not going anywhere as the people that want them will find ways to use them.

The Bottom Line
Privacy tokens have a place in the world, as privacy is something many people long for. These cryptocurrencies promise a life away from government and enterprise snooping that many people desire.

However, privacy for average law-abiding citizens means more privacy for criminals, so it's difficult to say whether privacy cryptocurrencies will be available in the future.
