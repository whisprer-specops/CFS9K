# How to assemble CFS9k from code in sections sequenctially:

## Phase 1: Project Structure

Create Folder Structure

bash
`mkdir -p card_fraud_simulator_9000/{frontend,backend}`
`cd card_fraud_simulator_9000`

Create Basic Frontend
- A fake card checkout form using HTML and JS.
- Collects: card number, expiry, CVV, ZIP, and email.
- Sends a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/submit.`

Create Backend with FastAPI
- Python main.py using FastAPI.
- Add a `/submit` endpoint.

Simulates fraud detection with simple scoring:
- Invalid card number/CVV → +2 points
- Wrong ZIP/Email format → +1 point
- 10% chance of false positive.
- If score ≥ 5 → decline. Else → accept.

Run It

bash
`cd backend`
`uvicorn main:app --reload`

Then open `frontend/index.html` in your browser to test it out.

## 💸 Phase 2: Simulated Crypto Tumbler (aka “mixer”)
Add `tumbler.py` in backend

Simulates laundering stolen crypto:
- Starts with a “dirty” wallet.
- Randomly hops through a graph of fake wallets.
- Logs all hops, time delays, and activity.
- Triggers honeypots if needed (wallets designed to catch bad actors).

Integrate it
- Add a new `/launder` POST endpoint in main.py.

It:
- Accepts card data.
- Initiates laundering simulation.
Returns:
- Final clean wallet address.
- Wallet history log.
- Transaction graph.
- Trigger It from the Frontend

Add a second button: "Launder via Crypto"
- Sends the same form data to `/launder`

Displays:
- Clean wallet address
- Hop history
- Graph (as raw JSON)

## 📊 Phase 3: Visualization & Fraud Detection
- Add Graph Visualizer
- Add visualizer.py with NetworkX + matplotlib.
- Add a `/visualize` endpoint that:

Runs laundering
- Renders transaction graph to graph.png
- Returns the image

Try It:

bash
`curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/visualize \`
`-H "Content-Type: application/json" \`
`-d '{"card_number": "4212123412341234", "expiry_date": "11/28", "cvv": "777", "zip": "12345", "email": "phisher@darkmail.biz"}'`

## 🧠 Phase 4: Honeypots, Threat Detection & Intelligence
Bot Fingerprinting

Add a `/fingerprint` endpoint to record:
- IP address
- Headers
- User-agent
- Store bot scores in`bot_radar.py` (in-memory)

Threat-Adaptive Tumbler
- When laundering, if the IP had a high bot score:
- Increase aggressiveness.
- Force early honeypot encounters.
- Trigger alarms.

## 🐝 Phase 5: Fake Storefront Honeypot
Create honeyshoppe.html
- A fake e-commerce store for "handmade soap and candles".
- Card entry form + Pay & Place Order button.
- Sends data to `/submit`.
- Make It Look Cheap & Realistic
- Deliberate typos.
- Fake testimonials.
- Stock images.
- No SSL or favicon.

## 🧠 Phase 6: Smart Mixers with Evasion Behavior
- Upgrade the Tumbler
- Give wallets a suspicion score.
- Avoid known honeypot paths.
- Mix in fake-safe nodes (noise).
- Introduce delays to simulate real-world laundering latency.

### 🎯 Bonus: Dashboard (In Progress)
You can now build:
- Real-time Graph Viewer
- Fraud Path Analyzer
- Mixer Intelligence Tracker
- Bot Fingerprint Radar Feed
